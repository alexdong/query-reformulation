I am working on producing a set of synthetic data of subqueries through 
graph traversal of a local filesystem. The directory stores ./facts about
entities, their properties, and relationships to other entities. 

1. Data Source
----------------

The data source is produced by recursively querying LLM about properties and
relationship to other entities. Even though there might be some hallucinations
in the data, the data is still useful for the purpose of this project.

The prompt is [[PROMPT-entity_properties_relationship-extraction.md]] and 
The LLM is gemma3:12b through `ollama-python` binding.

2. Generation the Data
------------------------

The data is generated by the following steps:

1. Randomly ask LLM for "The Lord of the Rings". The response looks like this:

```json
{
  "entity": "The Lord of the Rings",
  "properties": {
    "author": "J. R. R. Tolkien",
    "genre": "High fantasy",
  },
  "relationship": [
    {"prequel": "The Hobbit"},
    {"major_event": "War of the Ring"},
    {"has_part": "The Fellowship of the Ring"}
  ]
}```
2. Store the entity and properties into facts/{entity-name}.json file.
3. Go through each of the related entities and repeat the process from 1.
