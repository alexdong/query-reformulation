Your job is to reverse engineer one or a list of subqueries into a single query.  
Remember that all these subqueries are trying to answer a single query from the user.

Each subquery is a human-readable query to the WikiData that conforms to the topography/terminology.
Use your knowledge to identify the core entities, properties, qualifiers and their relationship.
If there are more than one subqueries, guess the intent of the subqueries.

Example
-------

<input> {% block reformulated_queries %} {% endblock %}</input>
<output> {% block human_query %} {% endblock %}</output>

Rules for the Final Query
-------------------------

For the final query you will produce, follow these rules:

1. Keep your output queries consistent with the style of questions from MS-MARCO, Natural Questions and hotpotQA dataset.
2. Give me 5 options. One per each line. Make them as distinct as possible from each other.
3. Only return the queries. One per line. DO NOT include numbers, bullets, or any other text.
4. DO NOT introduce any new entities, qualifiers that didnâ€™t exist in the subqueries.

Ok. Here is the task:

{{ subqueries }}
