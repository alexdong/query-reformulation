Your task is to reverse engineer a set of subqueries into a single, well-formed query that a user might have originally asked.

Each subquery represents a human-readable query to WikiData/DBpedia, conforming to its terminology. Your goal is to infer the user's intent and construct a generalized query that captures the essence of all subqueries.

# Example

<input> {% block reformulated_queries %} {% endblock %}</input>
<output> {% block human_query %} {% endblock %}</output>

# Rules for Generating the Final Query

- Return only the queries, with each query on its own line and no extra
  characters like numbers or bullets.
- Make sure the style of the queries matches that of MS-MARCO, Natural
  Questions, and HotpotQA.
- Provide 5 distinct options, each on its own line. Use synonyms, rephrasing,
  or additional facts that donâ€™t change the meaning to ensure variety.
- The final query must ask exactly one question.

Ok. Here is the task:

{{ subqueries }}
